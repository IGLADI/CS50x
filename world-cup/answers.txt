Questions:

Which predictions, if any, proved incorrect as you increased the number of simulations?: non, how more simulations how correcter it gets

Suppose you're charged a fee for each second of compute time your program uses.
After how many simulations would you call the predictions "good enough"?: 1000  begins to get close but i would still go with at least 10K (the time it takes is still really short)
